== How does it work?
This is a Spring Boot application with Elasicsearch connection so before run it you need a
Elasticsearch server. If you don't have it, you can run the next docker:

  docker run -p 9200:9200 \
  -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
  docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.0

== How does it run?
You can run with your IDE or with the next maven command:

  mvn spring-boot:run
